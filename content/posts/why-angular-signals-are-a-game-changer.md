ðŸ’¡ **TL;DR**:
Angular 18 signals make state management reactive, simple, and performant â€” all without RxJS ceremony. Perfect for managing local UI state in a predictable, clean way.

## What is Angular 18?

Angular 18 continues the frameworkâ€™s evolution towards greater performance and developer experience. One of its most exciting features is **Signals** â€” a reactive primitive introduced to enable fine-grained reactivity with better performance and predictability than the existing `RxJS`-driven model.

## What Are Signals?

Signals are a new **reactive state management mechanism** in Angular. They are **mutable**, **trackable**, and **automatically trigger updates** when their value changes â€” making them a natural fit for UI binding and reactive logic.

Unlike `BehaviorSubject` or `Observable`, signals are **synchronous**, **pull-based**, and work **without the need for subscriptions** or `async` pipes.

## Why Do We Need Signals?

In traditional Angular, reactive state handling often involved RxJS. While powerful, it required a lot of boilerplate and could lead to unreadable and complex code for smaller applications.

With **signals**, Angular developers get:

- **Better performance** (fewer change detection cycles)
- **Simpler mental model**
- **Cleaner templates and components**
- **No need to unsubscribe**

## A Quick Example of Signals

Hereâ€™s how you define and use signals in Angular 18:

### ðŸ”¹ Define a signal

```ts
import { signal } from "@angular/core";

export class CounterComponent {
  count = signal(0);

  increment() {
    this.count.update((c) => c + 1);
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Use it in your template

```html
<button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
<p>Count: {{ count() }}</p>
```

Notice how `count()` is used as a **function**, not a variable. That's because it's a **getter function** behind the scenes.

## Computed Signals

You can derive values from other signals using `computed`:

```ts
import { computed, signal } from "@angular/core";

export class PriceComponent {
  quantity = signal(2);
  pricePerUnit = signal(10);

  totalPrice = computed(() => this.quantity() * this.pricePerUnit());
}
```

Now `totalPrice()` will **automatically update** if either `quantity` or `pricePerUnit` changes.

## Effects

Want to react to changes? Use `effect`:

```ts
import { effect } from "@angular/core";

effect(() => {
  console.log("Total price changed:", this.totalPrice());
});
```

This is Angularâ€™s version of `watchEffect` from Vue or MobX reactions â€” a way to **respond to state changes**.

## Whatâ€™s in it for you?

If youâ€™ve struggled with boilerplate-heavy state handling or unnecessary change detection, signals offer a cleaner, leaner alternative. They bring Angular closer to the **reactive programming comfort** that developers experience in frameworks like Solid.js or Vue 3 â€” without giving up Angularâ€™s structure.

Angular 18's signal API is the beginning of a broader reactivity overhaul that will eventually power more optimized rendering and a **zone-less Angular** future. ðŸš€
