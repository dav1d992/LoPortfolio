## What is Next.js? 
Next.js is an open-source framework for creating universal React applications. By framework, I mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

## What makes Next.js powerful? 
Traditional react applications are rendered client-side. That means when a user lands on your website, the user's browser starts with only a *template* of an html page. This template has no rendered content in it. The Browser then needs to fetch the javascript file containing the react code. From there, the browser renders the content to the page. One drawback would be that it can take longer to reach the first concentful page. 

Next.js provides an out-of the box solution for rendering content in advance server-side. That means the user sees the fully rendered html first. When the initial page is received, client-side takes over and the application functions as a traditional react application.
